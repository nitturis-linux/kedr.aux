For collect statistic from one machine:

./usage_kernel_functions.sh > results/<system_name>.txt

It is better to not use whitespace in <system_name>.

For join statistic from several machines into one file:

./concatenate_statistics.pl results/*.txt > total_usage_statistic.txt

For filter resulting statistics to exclude "not interesting" symbols
and to join statistic for symbols, which really have same meaning:

cat total_usage_statistic.txt | filter_table.pl exclude_functions.txt | join_synonyms.pl synonym_functions.txt > total_usage_statistic_processed.txt

(NB) On some systems object files for modules are gzipped, and for purpose of preprocessing
them are unsipped to the temporary file in the current directory.
It is better to run scripts from the directory, where they are.

Auxiliary scripts:

./imported_functions.pl <ko-file>

Output list of kernel functions, used by module, representing by this file.

./imported_functions_for_modules.pl <list of modules>

Output list of functions, used by modules in the given list.

./modules_list.pl

Output list of modules, which is currently running.
Similar to `lsmod` output, but only modules list.
