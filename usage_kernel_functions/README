Usage example:

./usage_kernel_functions.sh > results/<system_name>.txt

Output contains list of functons, used by that modules, which are currently running on the OS.
Numbers corresponding to each function represent number of modules which use this function.

(NB) On some systems object files for modules are gzipped, and for purpose of preprocessing
them are unsipped to the temporary file in the current directory.
It is better to run scripts from the directory, where they are.

Auxiliary scripts:

./imported_functions.pl <ko-file>

Output list of kernel functions, used by module, representing by this file.

./imported_functions_for_modules.pl <list of modules>

Output list of functions, used by modules in the given list.

./modules_list.pl

Output list of modules, which is currently running.
Similar to `lsmod` output, but only modules list.
