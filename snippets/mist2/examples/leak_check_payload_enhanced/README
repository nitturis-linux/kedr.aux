Example demonstrates some features of mist2, like joining of templates,
bounded by 'with' scope and 'if' statement, and indentation of template
value.

Also example demonstrate such feature of YAML as anchored nodes and
how to use this feature for 'global storage' of functions prototypes.

Some complexity of templates adds possibility to redefine any part of
function prototype, taken from storage: name used for handler or
arguments list for redefine name(s) of them.
Otherwise number of additional templates may be easily reduced to 2
('argumentSpec_comma' and 'argumentsSpec_comma').
