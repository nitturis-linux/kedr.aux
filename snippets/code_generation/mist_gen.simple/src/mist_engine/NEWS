MiST Engine 1.0.0 beta 2 released.

Note that although it is formally "beta", the engine itself should be stable. 
It is still beta only because MiST documentation is not provided yet. It is a 
work in progress to assemble and "polish" the documentation from several 
sources including T2C documentation, man page for "mist_engine" command line 
tool, comments in the public headers of MiST library describing the public API, 
etc.

Most important changes in this version:
    * Enhancements and fixes related to handling of conditional constructs in 
the templates (support for choosing a branch depending on whether a parameter 
or a subtemplate has at least one non-empty value, etc.).
    * Several fixes in handling of incorrect input data and in error reporting.

See ChangeLog for the detailed information about the changes in this 
version.
