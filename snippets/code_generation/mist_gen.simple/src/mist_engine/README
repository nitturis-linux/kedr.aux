MiST (Minimal String Template) Engine provides a library (C API) and a command line tool for generation of data based on special templates. 

In some cases, the templates are little more than just "documents with holes" where the engine sticks appropriate data. Each "hole", or placeholder, has a name and can be assigned one or more values or even none at all. A more complex template can refer to other templates ("subtemplates"), this is as if the subtemplates were included in the template.

The core parts of this engine are used in T2C ("Template-to-Code") system for template-based generation of test sources and other files in test suites.

See doc/html/mist-doc/index.html for details.
