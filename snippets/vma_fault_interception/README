Intercept 'fault' callback in 'vm_area_struct', created as
result of mmap() system call.

Such interception may be usefull when create model of memory
allocation/free:
Page return from 'fault' handler is automatically added to
vm_area_struct object and freed when this object is deleted.

mremap() system call is also processed correctly.

Example use KEDR platform and KEDR COI library for intercept
given handler in kernel module.
Aside from KEDR COI library, example concerned with file
system operations interception from KEDR COI is used.

                    Configuration.
./configure.sh script should be used for configuration.
Before its call:
'KEDR_INSTALL_PREFIX' should be set to the installation prefix
of KEDR,
'KEDR_COI_INSTALL_PREFIX' should be set to the installation
prefix of KEDR COI.

                    Building.
'make' utility should be used for build example.

                    Using.
'vma_fault_interception.conf' file should be used as
configuration file for KEDR for load payload with 'fault' handler
interception functionality.
