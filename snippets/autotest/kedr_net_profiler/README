Autotest profiler based on KEDR leak checker, which may be used with already written tests.

This profiler allows to check the modules of the following kinds: 
-modules that can be unloaded using simple rmmod 
-modules that require to stop a network interface before rmmod 
-modules that first need to unload other modules using the above mechanisms.

Python file is a profiler code itself, 'control' file is an example of application of profiler to existing test.
This example shows how to choose module for verification by the KEDR leak checker and how to set dependency between modules and net interfaces.
