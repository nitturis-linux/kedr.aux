 * kedr_save_stack_trace_impl() saves up to 'max_entries' stack trace
 * entries in the 'entries' array provided by the caller. 
 * After the call, *nr_entries will contain the number of entries actually
 * saved. 
 *
 * The difference from save_stack_trace() is that only the entries from 
 * above the call point will be saved. That is, the first entry will
 * correspond to the caller of the function that called 
 * kedr_save_stack_trace_impl(), etc. We are not often interested in the 
 * entries corresponding to the implementation of save_stack_trace(),
 * that is why the 'lower' entries will be omitted.
 *
 * This function is intended to be used in the replacement functions, so
 * it is not that important that it will not store the entry corresponding 
 * to its direct caller.
 * The question that a function "asks" by calling 
 * kedr_save_stack_trace_impl() is "Who called me?"
 *
 * 'max_entries' should not exceed KEDR_MAX_FRAMES.
 *
 * 'entries' should have space for at least 'max_entries' elements.
 *
 * 'first_entry' is the first stack entry we are interested in. It is 
 * usually obtained with __builtin_return_address(0). 
 * [NB] If the results of save_stack_trace() are not reliable (e.g. if that
 * function is a no-op), 'entries[0]' will contain the value of 
 * 'first_entry' and '*nr_entries' will be 1.
