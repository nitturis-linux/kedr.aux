This payload module allows to perform fault simulation and call tracing for 
the function dealing with socket buffers (skb) - see <linux/skbuff.h>, etc.

The data file provided here should be used with "custom_payload_fsim" 
example installed with KEDR. See the docs for that example for the 
instructions, section "Writing Custom Payloads for Fault Simulation" in the 
manual:
