@tool_name@ stat - print statistic about source code coverage

    @tool_name@ stat [OPTIONS] <trace>

Prints statistic information about <trace> file, contained source code
coverage.
By default, next format is used for statistic:

Lines: %pl%% (%l of %L)
Functions: %pf%% (%f of %F)
Branches: %pb%% (%b of %B)

Meaning of '%' specificators is given below in the description of '-f'
option.

Possible OPTIONS are:

    -o <out-file>
        Output to the given file instead of STDOUT.
    
    -p <prefix>
        Collect statistic only for source files, which starts with given
        prefix.
        If <prefix> is not started with '/', it is prepended with common
        prefix for all source files in the trace file.

    -f <format>
        Use given format for statistics instead of default one.
        Aside from text, which is output 'as is', next specificators may
        be used:
        
        %L - output total number of lines,
        %l - output number of lines which are hit,
        %pl - output percents of lines which are hit,
        %F - output total number of functions,
        %f - output number of functions which are hit,
        %pf - output percents of functions which are hit,
        %B - output total number of branches,
        %b - output number of branches which are hit,
        %pb - output percents of branches which are hit
        
        %% - output '%' character

        Percentage data is output using '%.2f' printf-specifier. Note,
        that 0.0% is output only when number in question is 0,
        100.0% is output only when number in question is equal to total
        number. If total number is 0, '*' is output.
