@tool_name@ operation - performs per-counter operation with trace(s)

    @tool_name@ [operation] <op-name> [OPTIONS] <trace> ...
    @tool_name@ operation <op-file> [OPTIONS] <trace> ...

Performs per-counter operation with given traces. Resulted trace is
printed into STDOUT.

Predefined operation is given using its name(the first synopsis case). In that
case, 'operation' keyword may be omitted.

List of predefined operations:

    - diff
      
      Compute per-counter difference between first and second trace
      arguments. If resulted counter becomes negative, it is set to 0.

    - add
    
      Compute per-counter sum for all given traces.

    - new-coverage
    
      Reset(set to 0) all positive counters in the first trace,
      for which corresponded counters in the second trace are also positive.


Alternatively, user-defined operation may be used(the second synopsis case).
In that case, <op-file> should be filename of the module (shared library).
That module should defined operation in a way, described in
trace_operation_include/README.
Note, that filename should include '/' character, otherwise it will be
interpreted as name of predefined operation.

Possible OPTIONS are:

    -p <param>[=<value>][,...]
        Comma-separated list of parameter definitions, which may modify
        operation's semantic.
        Different operations accepts different parameters.
        
        None of predefined operations uses parameters.

    -o <out-file>
        Save resulted trace in the given file instead of output it to
        STDOUT.
