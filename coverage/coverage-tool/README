coverage_tool - utility for manipulation with coverage traces, produced
by lcov.

3 mods are implemented:

- add
    Sum corresponded counters from traces

- diff
    Substract counters from the second trace from corresponded ones in
    the first trace. If counter became negative, it is set to 0.

- new-coverage
    Reset all positive counters in the first trace, that are also
    positive in the second one. That is, only those lines
    (branches, functions) remain covered in the first trace,
    which are not covered in the second one.


                        BUILD
Build is implemented using cmake utility:

# cd <build-dir>
# cmake <sources-dir>
# make

For successfull build, next programs should be installed:

- lex (flex)
- bison (yacc)


After building, 'coverage_tool' utility appears under <build-dir>.

                        USING

    coverage_tool add trace1 trace2 ... [options]

sum all given traces,
    

    coverage_tool diff trace trace_sub [options]

substract counters of 'trace_sub' from 'trace',


    coverage_tool new-coverage trace trace_prev [options]

perform corresponded operation on counters of 'trace' and 'trace_prev'.


For all modes, resulted trace is written into STDOUT, or, if option

    -o filename

is present, to the file given in that option.

Currently, '-o' is the only option for utility.
