For implement user-defined trace operation one should create module(shared library), which:

1) include trace_operation.hh

2) implement class derived TraceOperation one.

3) define method
    extern "C" TraceOperation* getOperation(int n, const map<string,string>& params)
   
   which return TraceOperation object for given 'n' and 'params'.
   Usually object is created using 'new' operator.
   
4) define method
    extern "C" void getOperation(TraceOperation* op)

   which release object, created by getOperation.
   Usually object is released using 'delete' operator.
