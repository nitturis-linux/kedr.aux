@tool_name@ optimize-tests - optimize set of tests according to their coverage

    @tool_name@ optimize-tests [OPTIONS] <tests-file>

Accept <tests-file> described set of the tests.
Each line of that file describe one test in format

    <weight> <trace-file>

where 'trace-file' is a file contained coverage information for test
and 'weight' is floating-point characteristic of the test,
which  allow to arrange tests subsets: the less sum of the weights,
the more preferrable test subset.

Command find tests subset with minimal total weight which has same
lines coverage as whole set.

Command output list of coverage trace files in minimal tests subset.


Possible OPTIONS are:

    -o <out-file>
        Save list of traces in the given file instead of output it into
        STDOUT.
    
    -v
        Output additional operation into stderr.
