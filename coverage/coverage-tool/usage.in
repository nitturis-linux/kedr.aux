    @PROGRAM_NAME@ -h|--help
        Print given usage information and exit.    

'op' command performs per-counter operation <op-name> with given traces.
    Resulted trace is printed into stdout or, if '-o' option is given,
    into file specified by that option.
    
    Valid operation names (<op-name>) are:

    - diff
      
      Compute per-counter difference between first and second trace
      arguments. If resulted counter becomes negative, it is set to 0.

    - add
    
      Compute per-counter sum for all given traces.

    - new-coverage
    
      Reset(set to 0) all positive counters in the first trace,
      for which corresponded counters in the second trace are also positive.
    
    - filename (contains '/') of module (shared library) with
      user-defined trace operation.
      See trace_operation_include/README for create such module.

'stat' command output statistic information about trace according to
    format.

'optimize-tests' command accept <tests-file> described set of the tests.
    Each line of that file describe one test in format
    
        <weight> <trace-file>

    where 'trace-file' is a file contained coverage information for test
    and 'weight' is floating-point characteristic of the test,
    which  allow to arrange tests subsets: the less sum of the weights,
    the more preferrable test subset.
    
    Command find tests subset with minimal total weight which has same
    lines coverage as whole set.
    
    Command output list of coverage trace files in minimal tests subset.

Options:
    -o <out-file>
        Instead of output result into STDOUT, save it in the given file.
    -f format
        Use given format instead of default for output statistic about
        trace. Aside from text, which is output 'as is', next
        specificators are accepted:
        
        %L - output total number of lines,
        %l - output number of lines which are hit,
        %pl - output percents of lines which are hit,
        %F - output total number of functions,
        %f - output number of functions which are hit,
        %pf - output percents of functions which are hit,
        %B - output total number of branches,
        %b - output number of branches which are hit,
        %pb - output percents of branches which are hit
        
        %% - output '%' character
    
    -v
        Output additional information into stderr.
