Usage:
    @PROGRAM_NAME@ diff [-o <out-file>] <trace> <trace-sub>
    @PROGRAM_NAME@ add [-o <out-file>] <trace> ... 
    @PROGRAM_NAME@ new-coverage [-o <out-file>] <trace> <trace-prev> 
    @PROGRAM_NAME@ stat [-o <out-file>] [-f format] <trace> 
    

'diff' command compute per-counter difference between <trace> and
    <trace-sub>. That is, set every counter in <trace>, which is
    positive and for which correspondent counter is positive to the
    difference between these counters. If resulter counter become
    negative, it is set to 0.

'add' command compute per-counter sum for all given traces.

'new-coverage' command reset(set to 0) all positive counters in <trace>
    for which corresponded counters in <trace-prev> are also positive.

'stat' command output statistic information about trace according to
    format.

Options:
    -o <out-file>
        Instead of output result into STDOUT, save it in given file.
    -f format
        Use given format instead of default for output statistic about
        trace. Aside from text, which is output 'as is', next
        specificators are accepted:
        
        %L - output total number of lines,
        %l - output number of lines which are hit,
        %pl - output percents of lines which are hit,
        %F - output total number of functions,
        %f - output number of functions which are hit,
        %pf - output percents of functions which are hit,
        %B - output total number of branches,
        %b - output number of branches which are hit,
        %pb - output percents of branches which are hit
        
        %% - output '%' character
        

    @PROGRAM_NAME@ -h|--help
        
        print given usage information and exit.
